Hi {{ user.username }}!

Back a while ago, you were using shortdiary. However, we noticed you
haven't added any entries lately :(.

Hopefully you have at least kept some other form of diary since then! If
not, here's a bunch of reasons to remind you why you should, shortdiary or not!

http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/journal-writing-5-smart-reasons-why-you-should-start-doing-today.html

So, why not create a diary entry right now? It's going to take only five
seconds: https://shortdiary.me/posts/new/

By the way – Since you visited us last, quite a lot has changed:

  * Individual privacy settings for each post – Instead of having to set your
    whole account to private or public, you can now do that on a per-post
    basis!

  * Post locations – You can now add locations to your posts and get
    statistics based on them.

  * Mentioning people – You can now @mention people in your posts, whose
    names will be hidden if the post is public. You also get a list of
    who you mention the most!

  * Streaks – See how long you are able to post continually in a row.
    The current record is 251 days, so get postin'!

  * Leaderboard & global statistics – Stats only on yourself are boring.
    That's why shortdiary now has global stats, including most popular
    cities and more.

We're also always super curious about your feedback. Just hit the reply
button in your mail client to send an email to a human!

Kindly yours,
    the friendly shortdiary robot
