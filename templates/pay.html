<h2>Sorry, but your free trial is over :(</h2>

<p>We both knew it would come to this. Your free trial is over and now we're greedily asking you for your precious, hard-earned money. Who do these diary people think they are anyways! Just asking for people's money like that!</p>
<p>Obviously, it isn't as simple as this. Running and developing shortdiary costs a lot of money. And making sure your data stays private does, too. Blah blah blah.</p>

<h2>Simple & fair pricing</h2>

<p>Our pricing is both fair and simple: 1â‚¬ per month, that's it. And you can cancel anytime, just by clicking a button!<br />No shady adhesion contracts.</p>

<p>Haven't tested just everything yet? We've got you covered.</p>
